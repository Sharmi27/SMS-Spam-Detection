# SMS-Spam-Detection
SMS spam detection is a project that involves using machine learning algorithms to identify unsolicited and unwanted text messages sent to mobile devices. The goal of the project is to develop a model that can accurately classify incoming text messages as either spam or legitimate messages.

To build the model, the project involves collecting a large dataset of SMS messages and their associated labels (spam or not spam). The data is then preprocessed, which includes text normalization techniques such as stemming, stop-word removal, and character encoding to make it suitable for analysis.

The next step is to extract features from the text data. This can be done using techniques such as bag of words or TF-IDF, which transform the text data into a numerical representation that can be used to train a machine learning model.

Once the features have been extracted, various machine learning algorithms can be used to train the model. Popular algorithms for SMS spam detection include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests. The model is trained on a portion of the data and then evaluated on a separate test dataset to measure its accuracy and effectiveness.

The final step is to deploy the model in a real-world setting, such as a mobile app or web service, where it can analyze incoming text messages in real-time and flag any potential spam messages for the user's attention. SMS spam detection is an important project as it helps to protect users from fraudulent, unsolicited messages and helps to enhance their mobile experience.
